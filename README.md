Here is a page dedicated to learn how to integrate website with API which is downloaded from other websites. 
Actually I integrated weather app and did CSS for this, later on I will keep addjusting the style of the web page. 

To open this you need to download all the files including picture folder and run it with Visual Studio Code. 
On the main page (index.html) you can scroll down and click for Weather site to chceck actual weather in Babice, PL. It will be possible to choose one of the major cities in the next versions of this app. 

Now there is a possibility to set the weather by using the Name of the city.
You need to open the weather.js file and on the top change the name of city_coord to anything you want! 
This will be updated in the next session to clickable list.  

Now you can type the city and set the weather!

I will change the look of this in the next coding session. 

The look of the button and input has been changed.

Look of the input and button has been updated. I also added dropdown list with few cities! Now you can choose one and get the weather!
