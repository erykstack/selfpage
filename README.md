Here is a page dedicated to learn how to integrate website with API which is downloaded from other websites. 
Actually I integrated weather app and did CSS for this, later on I will keep addjusting the style of the web page. 

To open this you need to download all the files including picture folder and run it with Visual Studio Code. 
On the main page (index.html) you can scroll down and click for Weather site to chceck actual weather in Babice, PL. It will be possible to choose one of the major cities in the next versions of this app.
